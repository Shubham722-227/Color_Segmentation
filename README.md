# Color_Segmentation
This project explores various color segmentation techniques in MATLAB, focusing on RGB color space thresholding and hue-based segmentation in the HSI (Hue, Saturation, Intensity) or HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color spaces. We aim to segment objects in images based on color and compare the effectiveness of these methods.
